# Contributing - Readme

Welcome to the contribution section of the nscale documentation. This section is new and is still growing.
Any issues or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

The following guides can be done sequentially to get you set up with a full hackable version of nscale.
They also work as standalone documents.

2. [Learn how to 'hack' nscale containers/dependencies and wire them up to the kernel][containers]
3. [Set up a development version of the nscale client][nscale-client]
4. [Submitting pull requests - general guidelines][pull-requests]
